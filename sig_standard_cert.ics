SUMMARY:SIG Standardization/Certification
UID:5553e196-fcfe-43f8-ae52-10f94d5a9769@5553.org
DESCRIPTION:In this Special Interest Group\, we discuss and align our 
 activities and approach to standardization and certification. That is to 
 say\, we devise and refine the relevant concepts and processes\; we work 
 on a roadmap for new certificate versions\; and we align on which 
 standards are desireable for each certificate subject. We then work with 
 the teams to align on existing or new standards.\n\nBesides aspects of 
 openness and sovereignty\, the main goal of our standards is 
 interoperability. We should take the user perspective: As a member of a 
 DevOps team developing a service (think SaaS or PaaS) for SCS\, I need 
 XYZ. Every standard should be abstract enough to work regardless of the 
 SCS reference implementation.\n\nThis SIG is a joint effort by SCS and 
 ALASCA.\n\nMinutes:
