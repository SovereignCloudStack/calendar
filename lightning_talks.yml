      As community we set out to foster standardization among cloud offerings and create a well-trusted certification that users can rely on. To simplify testing an environment against these standards Kurt and Eduard have started to work on a compliance check tool. This lightning talk sheds some light on our approach to publish the upcoming certification program in a machine-readable way and offers a first live demonstration of the SCS compliance tool.

      If you have a growing number of VMs running in various OpenStack projects or clouds, it may quickly become tedious to access them with ssh/scp, looking up (floating) IPs and then copy-pasting the addresses and remembering user names and SSH keypairs associated with them. This lightning talk drills down into the motivation of Kurt to develop a tool that queries OpenStack cloud servers and automatically creates a ssh config files for them.
