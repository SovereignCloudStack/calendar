      With our first meetup we want to enter directly the world of cloud
      operations and making it transparent: Christian from OSISM and Julian from
      JH-Computing tell us how they dealt with a power outage and how they found
      proper solutions.

      In the second part of the meetup there will be plenty of time for your experience!

      What does it take to run Kubernetes clusters? What tools should be integrated? How should they be coordinated?

      We answer these questions and show insights into the CLOPS platform - Cloud Operations Platform - automated roll-out, all necessary tools integrated, usable even for complex cluster architectures. And everything is open-source!

      In the second part of the meetup there will be plenty of time for your experience!

      Cloud Interconnectivity aims to provide seamless connectivity between clouds, enabling VMs and tenants across different cloud environments to communicate directly via VPN or IXP links. In this meetup Angel and Bozhidar from Daiteap present the Cloud Interconnectivity solution from the SCS project, which approach they choose and why.

      Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is, as its name suggests, a stack of multiple layers of software. We use IaaS, we use Kubernetes, and then there's tools around. The powerful benefit of using SCS is the aligned composition of all these parts to have one production-ready package. But nevertheless, the original APIs of these layers and tools still exist! To further enhance the operability of SCS, the Central API sub-project was initialized. With combining all "backend" APIs into one "frontend" API, end-users and customers have it much easier to interact with SCS-based installations. In this talk we'll look at the idea, the concepts and the current implementation status of the Central API. Questions and feedback are very welcome!
