      With our first meetup we want to enter directly the world of cloud
      operations and making it transparent: Christian from OSISM and Julian from
      JH-Computing tell us how they dealed with a power outage and how they found
      proper solutions.

      In the second part of the meetup there will be plenty of time for your experience!
