      With our first meetup we want to enter directly the world of cloud
      operations and making it transparent: Christian from OSISM and Julian from
      JH-Computing tell us how they dealt with a power outage and how they found
      proper solutions.

      In the second part of the meetup there will be plenty of time for your experience!

      What does it take to run Kubernetes clusters? What tools should be integrated? How should they be coordinated?

      We answer these questions and show insights into the CLOPS platform - Cloud Operations Platform - automated roll-out, all necessary tools integrated, usable even for complex cluster architectures. And everything is open-source!
