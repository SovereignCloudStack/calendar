# Public SCS community calendar
This repository contains various `yaml` files to announce public events, meetings and other interesting happenings of 
our [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community) community.

## Converting to `ics`
We'll make use of the python script [yaml2ics](https://github.com/scientific-python/yaml2ics), which in turn will automatically be published in a seperate branch.
