      As organizations demand greater control, compliance, and data sovereignty over their AI workloads, building and operating sovereign AI infrastructure has become a strategic imperative. In this webcast, Christian takes you behind the scenes of how they design, host, manage, and deploy fully sovereign AI infrastructure on top of their SCS Cloud — ensuring data residency, regulatory compliance, and operational autonomy without sacrificing performance or scalability.

      SCS Connect is our webinar series about SCS – with exciting topics ranging from technical insights and practical applications to tips on certification. The webinars are open to everyone and offer space for questions and discussion.

      Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is a European open-source project that develops standards for sovereign cloud infrastructures. The focus is on a cloud infrastructure with genuine freedom of choice: secure, interoperable, vendor-independent and cloud-native.
      This webinar answers the most important questions about the available certificates and the entire certification process.
      It is aimed at organizations, cloud providers, developers and decision-makers who are looking for a clear and practical introduction to the SCS certification.

      SCS Connect is our webinar series about SCS – with exciting topics ranging from technical insights and practical applications to tips on certification. The webinars are open to everyone and offer space for questions and discussion.

      In this webinar, you will gain first-hand insights into how the GovStack Initiative, together with the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS), enables sovereign cloud infrastructures worldwide. Through concrete international examples, our speakers will show how countries use SCS to operate secure, open, and independent government clouds while strengthening digital sovereignty. You will learn how open standards and open source help avoid dependencies and build sustainable cloud ecosystems. The speakers will also introduce the practical training and education offerings of GovStack and SCS. You will discover how to use these materials to build your own cloud expertise and receive support when getting started with SCS. Of course, there will be plenty of time for questions and discussion. Get inspired and benefit from international experiences around sovereign cloud infrastructures.

      We look forward to the exciting insights from Friederike and Kurt and to engaging discussions with you!

      The hackathon is organized for the SCS Community and brings together everyone interested in advancing digital sovereign cloud infrastructure within the context of the SCS project. While it is called a "hackathon", participation is not limited to coding: contributions range from hacking on code, improving documentation, shaping and reviewing standards, sharing knowledge, to simply exchanging ideas with like-minded experts.

      This edition will specifically focus on SCS Kubernetes-as-a-Service (KaaS) standards and certification. If you work with Kubernetes, want to actively contribute to the development of standards, and aim to move toward SCS certification, this hackathon provides the ideal environment to do so collaboratively and hands-on. The joint agenda and topics will be collected in a HedgeDoc. You can already add your topic suggestions there now.
