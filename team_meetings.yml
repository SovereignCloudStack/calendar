      Our SCS Product Board: This is our virtual technical leadership team: CPO, Team/SIG POs/Speakers, Key contributors. This tactically prepares the team meetings (sprint planning).
      But more importantly it takes a look at more strategic topics:
      - What is our roadmap?
      - How do we grow?
      - How do we organize ourselves?
      - What are key OSS/industry trends to take into account?
