      In this Special Interest Group, we discuss and align our activities and approach to standardization and certification. That is to say, we devise and refine the relevant concepts and processes; we work on a roadmap for new certificate versions; and we align on which standards are desireable for each certificate subject. We then work with the teams to align on existing or new standards.
      
      Besides aspects of openness and sovereignty, the main goal of our standards is interoperability. We should take the user perspective: As a member of a DevOps team developing a service (think SaaS or PaaS) for SCS, I need XYZ. Every standard should be abstract enough to work regardless of the SCS reference implementation.
      
      This SIG is a joint effort by SCS and ALASCA.
