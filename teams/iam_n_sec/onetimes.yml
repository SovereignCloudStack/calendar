      So we have worked on Identity federation support for years now, with various
      design workshops and -- what we believed -- good outcomes.
      Nevertheless we find ourselves confused and in situations where we start
      questioning the overall design and usefulness of what we've already built.
      Let's use the time to review what we have designed, what limitations that
      brings and also what we learned, especially things that may not have worked
      out. The things that do work should be documented for our users as well as
      the current limitations due to our implementation or design.

      2nd part of the workshop: So we hopefully have recorded what works and
      what does not in out current design.
      What directions can we take. What can be achieved in the next three months?
      What can we put into a good path going forward (even if we may have more
      limited implementation bandwidth in 2025)?
      Are we confident that we have better designs now that we can at least
      document as a starting point for a community to work on?
