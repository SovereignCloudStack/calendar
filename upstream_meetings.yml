      This is the (new) weekly meeting of the Gaia-X Open Source Software Community.
      Mission statement: The Gaia-X Open-Source Software (OSS) Community aims to engage and grow the Gaia-X developer community through outreach, onboarding, software development and the organization of the Gaia-X hackathon event.
      Mission Documents can be found on GitLab in the Operational Handbook (https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/technical-committee/operational-handbook/) and on the Gaia-X DCP (https://community.gaia-x.eu/f/14633138).
      Engagement: If you want to engage with the group please join our weekly meetings and collaborate with the Open-Source Software Community through the mailing list (oss-community@list.gaia-x.eu<mailto:oss-community@list.gaia-x.eu>) by sending a request (empty mail) to oss-community-request@list.gaia-x.eu<mailto:oss-community-request@list.gaia-x.eu>, the Gaia-X Slack (https://join.slack.com/t/gaia-xworkspace/shared_invite/zt-1cjc6bpqp-KgNBldvOXLIcDqS1I1o_sA) or the Matrix Chatroom (https://matrix.to/#/#gaiax-community:matrix.org), depending on your preferences.
      Our GitLab repository is located here: https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/gaia-x-community and the group, as an Open Work Package (OWP) does not require a Gaia-X membership.
